# Rover-Control-via-Mobile-App

Rovers are the pioneer of Mars exploration, they are functioned to search for possible life and samples whicih will be studied back on earth. Usually a real Rover is controlled by professional people in a command center. Meanwhile we want to build a similar Rover with similar functions such as GPS (Location) tracker, Light Control, Camera Surveillance and Camera Control, which can be controlled with an app on a mobile phone.
